# Lessons — repo notes for Claude

## Progress-tracking architecture (read this before touching anything auth/progress related)

There is **exactly one** backend for student progress tracking across this whole
repo: one Google Sheet + one Apps Script Web App deployment. Every lesson
activity, in every grade, talks to that same backend. **Do not create a new
Sheet or a new Apps Script deployment per activity or per project** — that was
the old pattern (see `Lessons/Projects/*/index.html`, each with its own
`SHEET_API_URL`) and it's exactly what this design replaces. Adding a new
activity means adding one row to `ActivityCatalog` in the shared Sheet, never
shipping new backend code.

### Identity

- Students sign in with **Sign in with Google** (Google Identity Services),
  restricted to `lincoln.edu.ni` accounts via the token's `hd` claim.
- OAuth Client ID (safe to reference in front-end code):
  `478111261772-7l1qamohr0fjsa7ekosuhpj9jum1q4vc.apps.googleusercontent.com`
  — Google Cloud project `lessons-progress-tracker`, OAuth consent screen type
  **External**, currently in **Testing** status (only accounts added as Test
  Users can sign in until it's published to Production).
- The `client_secret` for that OAuth client is **never** needed by this
  design (the sign-in flow only needs the Client ID) and must never be
  committed to this repo, added to any page, or stored anywhere public.
- Every request to the backend is verified server-side (Apps Script calls
  Google's `tokeninfo` endpoint) — the front-end's claimed identity is never
  trusted directly.

### The shared Sheet

One spreadsheet, four tabs. Canonical source of truth for the Apps Script
code that reads/writes it: `automation/apps-script/Code.gs` in this repo —
copy that file's contents into the Apps Script editor (Extensions → Apps
Script, from the Sheet) whenever it changes, then redeploy.

| Tab | Who fills it in | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `Roster` | **Manual** — teacher maintains: `Email, StudentName, Grade, Teacher, Section, Status` | Source of truth for who's allowed in and what grade/teacher they belong to. Add/remove students here directly in the Sheet. |
| `ActivityCatalog` | **Manual** — teacher adds one row per activity: `ActivityId, Title, Grade, Unit, Active` | Drives the grade-gate check. Adding a new lesson page = adding one row here, nothing else. |
| `Progress` | **Automatic** — written entirely by Apps Script | One row per (student, activity), upserted on every save. Columns: `Email, StudentName, Grade, Teacher, ActivityId, ActivityTitle, FirstStartedAt, LastSubmittedAt, ItemsTotal, ItemsAttempted, ItemsCorrect, ScorePct, Status, SubmissionsLog (JSON), FlagReason, ReviewedByTeacher, ReviewedAt`. The last two are the only cells a teacher should hand-edit (checking off a flagged row after review). |
| `AccessLog` | **Automatic** — written entirely by Apps Script | Every access attempt, allowed or denied, for audit: `Timestamp, Email, ActivityId, StudentGrade, RequiredGrade, Result, Reason`. Read-only. |

- **Spreadsheet ID**: `1-HLtX5AwskPx8hy_Ip2kjGMz5OUIS91M2x0FgEt75zA`
- **Apps Script Web App URL**: `TODO — fill in once deployed`

### Flow

1. Teacher shares an activity link.
2. Page shows a sign-in gate before any lesson content renders.
3. Student signs in with Google → front-end sends the ID token + `activityId`
   to the Apps Script backend as an `access-check` request.
4. Backend verifies the token, looks up `Roster`, compares `Roster.Grade`
   to `ActivityCatalog.Grade` for that activity, logs the result to
   `AccessLog`, and either denies or unlocks the page (returning any
   existing `Progress` row so the student resumes where they left off).
5. Every check/submission on the page also posts to the backend
   (`submission` request type) — appended into that same `Progress` row's
   `SubmissionsLog`, never a new row.

### Status as of this file's creation

Done: OAuth client + consent screen created, `hd`-domain check validated
live against a real `lincoln.edu.ni` account. Apps Script code drafted
(see `automation/apps-script/Code.gs`).

Not yet done: the Sheet itself hasn't been created, the script hasn't been
deployed, and no lesson page has been wired to any of this yet. Nothing
about student-facing pages should be assumed to work until that's true —
check this file's Spreadsheet ID / Web App URL fields above; if they still
say `TODO`, the backend doesn't exist yet.
